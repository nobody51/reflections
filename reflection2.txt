What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git allows the use of git commands within that directory.
You do this to enable version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is like a platform or loading bay that allows us to see what is about to go where.
The obejcts will only move if you commit.
This ensures that you know exactly what you're commiting.
