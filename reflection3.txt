When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I am collaborating with other people or when I'm working in multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    What we are working on locally might not work with the remote repository.
    Being conscious with the pull allows us version control.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork -copying within GitHub - used when I want to work off of someone elses repo as a foundation without touching the foundation
    Clones -copying from Github to local - used when i want to work on the project and contribute
    Branches -versions within my repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It provides a reference to compare to if there are new commits locally and remotely that share the same parent.
    This makes merging the two commits easier.
